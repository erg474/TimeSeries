Overview of Financial Time Series Analysis. With Stock Market and Machine Learning information being so readily available, 
the fact that there is not a consistent return for traders using it for trading should be noted. The stock market is a chaotic
system of order 2, so don't expect these algorithms to work automatically without thorough research into them.
In this repo I look into various methods for stock analysis and predictions, and find out whether these methods are viable.

A few Common Quantitative Methods for Financial Time Series Analysis are :
1. Random Forests
2. SVMs (Support-Vector Machines)
3. Neural Network Architectures
4. LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)

Other Useful Financial Investigations:
1. Discounted Cash Flow Models - Instrinsic Analysis
2. Fundamental Analysis
3. Technical Analysis on Random Walk Models, to test whether the Technical Analysis indicators are pseudoscientific
